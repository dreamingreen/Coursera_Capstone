When you want to open a new restaurant, you will have to think about why people would come to your place specifically and not another one, 
since restaurants are already very common big cities. In addition to making very good food, to have success, you have to take your time to think about the location in 
which you will rent or buy for it to be as strategic as possible. 
Do you like competition with other restaurants ? 
Do you want it to be from walking distance or is it ok for you to take the car ?
Which places would you like to be close to your restaurant ?

Let's imagine a case where our italian friend Antonio, who lives in Paris for his studies but is a little bit short on money, wants to open his pizza takeout business. 
He plans on making a homemade italian-style kind of pizzas, with whole ingredients.
He has some requirements:
- First, he wants it to be close to home and be able to walk to the location in 20min.
- Second, the business can be close to other pizza places. He doesn't mind the competition with other pizza restaurants since he's confident his homemade pizzas are the best.
- Third, he wants it to be close to a supermarket or a farmer's market so that he can shop for ingredients whenever he's missing something.
- Bonus if we can get it near a touristic place like "Arc de Triomphe" or "Les Champs Elys√©es"

What should be done:
Collect his home coordinates (longitude, latitude) and using Foursquare API, research for the pizza places that exist within 20min walking distance (look for the corresponding radius).
We would only like to be near "industrial" places such as "Pizza Hut". Other traditional pizza restaurants are a risk for us in terms of competition.
After selecting one or multiple visual radius of places where we can put our pizza place, we will search which one of the selected places has the closest supermarket, 
which will help us make our choice.
